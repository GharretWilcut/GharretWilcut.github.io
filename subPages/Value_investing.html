            I wanted to make this small tool because I was inspired from a conference I went to for one of my scholarships. <br>
            All it does is pull data from a YahooFinance API and calculate a score based off value investing criteria. This tool has flaws in that some 
            data is missing so the scores are sometimes incomplete.
