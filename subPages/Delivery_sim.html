            Me and my friends went and developed a Megaman inspired platformer based on a student from S&T going to school for an exam. <br>
            I mainly worked on the AI enemies and some of the artwork. This was a great learning experience with Git being a big problem early on, <br>
            we forgot to make a gitignore file which caused many merge conflicts but once that was resolved it went very smoothly.
